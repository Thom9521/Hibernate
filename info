Hibernate is a high-performance Object/Relational persistence and query service

Hibernate ORM (Hibernate in short) is an object-relational mapping tool for the Java programming language.
It provides a framework for mapping an object-oriented domain model to a relational database.
Hibernate handles object-relational impedance mismatch problems by replacing direct, persistent database
accesses with high-level object handling functions.
